An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers. An operating system is software that enables applications to interact with a computer's hardware. The software that contains the core components of the operating system is called the kernel. The primary purposes of an Operating System are to enable applications (spftwares) to interact with a computer's hardware and to manage a system's hardware and software resources. Some popular Operating Systems include Linux Operating System, Windows Operating System, VMS, OS/400, AIX, z/OS, etc. Today, Operating systems is found almost in every device like mobile phones, personal computers, mainframe computers, automobiles, TV, Toys etc."
